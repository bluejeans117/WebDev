            I'm a Computer Science Engineering student in my 3rd year. I've been into coding since I was 14 years old.
            I'm mostly an Android Developer (For Custom ROMs), currently working with <a class="text-secondary" href="https://evolution-x.org/">@EvolutionXRom</a> 
            and <a class="text-secondary" href="https://project404.co/">@Project404x</a> as an assistant lead Developer. I've had great experience with android app 
            development (Java and Kotlin, 3+ years). I'm extremely familiar with the Linux Shell, Git, DBMS (MySql, MongoDB and Firebase firestore),
            Computer Networks, and Cloud Computing Services (GCP, AWS and Azure). I'm also an avid gamer, Halo and Counter Strike being my favourite
            games of all time. I code bots (telegram, discord) and configure CI pipelines in my free time.

            I've worked with quite a few apps, ranging from music players, to file explorers,
            to corporate authentication applications, all with a very user-friendly and intuitive UI/UX.
            I have also integrated firebase capabilities to apps
            providing a very reliable backend to work with. I code apps mainly in Java, and sometimes Kotlin.

            I've set up multiple servers using GCP and AWS services, suck as Compute Engine, EC2, Lightsail,
            Kubernetes Engine, EKS, App Engine and a few more. I successfully configured each of these servers
            with linux distros and required tools with a remote connection, to perform various tasks such as 
            building android ROMs, hosting websites(with a fully functional backend), hosting telegram/discord bots,
            performing machine learning tasks and also to deploy mobile applications.

            I have been coding for over 7 years now. I have completed multiple courses/tests from websites such
            as Coursera, HackerRank, HackerEarth, LeetCode and Udemy. I place myself as an intermediate level programmer
            who is good at problem solving. I still learn new things and practice coding almost every day. I also teach
            programming to others, and hope to run a successful youtube channel one day. I'm familiar with C, C++, Java,
            Python, Golang, Kotlin, Ruby, Rust, JavaScript, XML, CSS, html, Bash, Perl, Awk and Tcl.
